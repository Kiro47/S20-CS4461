\question The following flows are entering a router: \SI{78}{kbps}, \SI{88}{kbps}, \SI{100}{kbps}, \SI{12}{kbps}.
\begin{parts}
\part[6] What is the Fairness Index for the set of flows?
\begin{solution}[2in]
	Jain's Fairness Index:
\begin{equation}
f\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n}\right)=\frac{\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}\right)^{2}}{n \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}^{2}}
\end{equation}
@{from sympy import *}
@{p1Flows = [78,88,100,12]}
@{p1FlowNumber = len(p1Flows)}
@{{{
def p1JaneDec(flows):
	val = 0
	for flow in flows:
		val += flow**2
	return val
}}}
\begin{center}
	Fairness Index:
\end{center}
$$
\frac
{
	(@{S('Sum(Symbol("f"),(i,1,4))')})^2
}
{
	n @{S('Sum(Symbol("f^2"),(i,1,4))')}
}
=
\frac
{
	@{sum(p1Flows) ** 2}
}
{
	@{p1FlowNumber * p1JaneDec(p1Flows)}
}
=
@{(sum(p1Flows) ** 2) / (p1FlowNumber * p1JaneDec(p1Flows))}
$$
\end{solution}
\part[3] Do you think these flows are fair? \textbf{Why or why not?}
\begin{solution}[2in]
	These flows seem to be relatively fair as more than a 2/3 of the of the flows are considered to be in fair.  Realistically, stating whether a set of flows is fair or not is difficult as it depends entirely on the stance of how they are being used.
	
	For example, if I chose to consider this set of flows on a single host I could consider it fair as the super slow connection could still be competently useful for things such as basic messaging services and update checks.  As they are only occasional and require little bandwidth.  On another hand, if I considered the set of flows to be on a switch and all four when to different hosts, then I might consider it unfair as one host is absolutely left in the dust in bandwidth comparisons.
\end{solution}
\end{parts}

\question[6] The MSS for a given TCP connection is \SI{1000}{bytes}. The current Congestion Window is \SI{1789}{bytes}. Show how the Congestion Window size changes when the next ACK arrives.
\begin{solution}[3in]
	\begin{center}
		Starting Congestion Window = 1789
		
		MSS = 1000
		
		Congestion Window incrementation:
		 \begin{equation}
		 	\mathrm{Increment} = \mathrm{MSS} * \frac{\mathrm{MSS}}{\mathrm{CongestionWindow}}
		 \end{equation}
		 
		 So on our next ACK we have the following for our increment:
		 \begin{equation}
		 	\mathrm{Increment} = \mathrm{1000} * \frac{\mathrm{1000}}{\mathrm{1789}} = 558.97
		 \end{equation}
		 Then our next congestion window will be the following:
		 \begin{equation}
		 	\mathrm{New Congestion Window} = \mathrm{1789} + \mathrm{558.97} = 2347.97
		 \end{equation}
	\end{center}
\end{solution}


\question[6] A router implementing RED has a maximum drop probability of 1.5\% (or 0.015). The $\mathrm{MaxThreshold}$ is set to 36 and the $\mathrm{MinThreshold}$ is set to 18. The running average of the queue length has just been calculated to be 19. Assuming that the queue length does not change, what is the probability that the 50th packet ($\mathrm{Count} = 50$) will be dropped?
\begin{solution}[3in]
Simplification:
\begin{center}
	$\bar{p}=$ MaxProb $. \frac{\text { AvgLength - MinThreshold }}{\text { MaxThreshold }-\text { Min Threshold }}$
	
	=
	
	$\bar{p}=$ 0.015 $. \frac{\text { 19 - 18 }}{\text { 36 }-\text { 18 }}$

	=
	
	$\bar{p}= 0.00083$
\end{center}

Calculating p:

\definecolor{gray}{rgb}{0.5,0.5,0.5}
\definecolor{mauve}{rgb}{0.58,0,0.82}
\lstset{frame=tb,
	language=Python,
	aboveskip=3mm,

	showstringspaces=false,
	columns=flexible,
	basicstyle={\small\ttfamily},
	numbers=none,
	numberstyle=\tiny\color{gray},
	keywordstyle=\color{blue},
	commentstyle=\color{dkgreen},
	stringstyle=\color{mauve},
	breaklines=true,
	breakatwhitespace=true,
	tabsize=4
}
\begin{lstlisting}
max_prob = 0.015
p_bar = 0.00083
for count in range(1,51):
	val = p_bar/(1 - count * (p_bar))
	print(f"Count[{count}]: {val}")
\end{lstlisting}
    Script:
\begin{lstlisting}
total_prob=0
for count in range(1,51):
	val = p_bar/(1 - count * (p_bar))
	if count == 1:
		total_prob=val
	else:
		total_prob = total_prob * val
	print(f"Count[{count}]: {val}")
	print(f"Current probability: {total_prob}")
print("Final probability of not dropping: {}".format(1.0 - total_prob))
\end{lstlisting}
    This results in the final probability of dropping to be $2.6306075607607903^{-154}$.
When we calculate the probability of it dropping it is $1 - 2.6306075607607903^{-154}$, which becomes:
\begin{equation}
1 - 2.6306075607607903^{-154} \approx 1
\end{equation}

Since we can say that the inverse is of the approximation is true from the calculation of not dropping to dropping: $ 1 \rightarrow 0 $.  Therefore, the probability of this $50^{\mathrm{th}}$ packet dropping is nearly a 100\% chance.
\end{solution}

\question[10] Define and list the responsibilities of the \textbf{control plane} and the \textbf{data plane} as they apply to the Network Layer.
\begin{solution}[3in]
	Control Plane: A part of router architectures that deal with generating network topology data and using that data to decide what to do with incoming packets.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Updating forwarding decisions
			\begin{itemize}
				\item when a better link is found
				\item when a link goes out of service
			\end{itemize}
		\item Building forwarding tables
		\item Defining packet forwarding routes based on known information
	\end{itemize}
	
	Data Plane: The specific portion of the router architecture that deals with actually sending and receiving packets along given links dictated by the Control Plane.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Forwarding a packet along the defined route. 
	\end{itemize}
\end{solution}

\question[12] A host launches three IP datagrams that have payloads of \SI{1280}{bytes}, \SI{1280}{bytes} and \SI{394}{bytes}. The MTU of the directly attached network is \SI{1460}{bytes}, but the destination host's network has an MTU of \SI{576}{bytes} (the ``minimum MTU'' supported by IP). Assume that these are the only two networks the datagrams must pass through. Indicate how each packet will be fragmented and specify for each fragment the size of each fragment's payload, the status of the ``more'' bit, and the value of the Offset field.

Suppose that the link between C and E fails. Assuming no count-to-infinity problems, show the series of updates that will eventually reconnect the nodes, along with the cost of the new path between C and E. You don't need to show every table swap---just focus on the updates pertaining to the failed link.

\bonusquestion \textbf{(bonus)} Typically CIDR address 0.0.0.0/0 is considered invalid. Assume we want to instead implement our software-defined network to support 0.0.0.0/0: should it match every IP address, or no IP address? While there is no correct decision, be sure to \textbf{justify your answer} with a short (sentence of two) reasoning using appropriate terminology.


\end{questions}
\begin{solution}[1in]
	I would saw that 0.0.0.0/0 should be valid for all IPV4 addresses.  My reasoning for this is essentially just due to that is how the math itself works out.
